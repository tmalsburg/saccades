* Saccade and Fixation Detection in R
** News
-  02/16/2015: ~saccades~ is now [[http://cran.uib.no/web/packages/saccades/index.html][available on CRAN]].

** Overview
An R package for saccade and fixation detection in eyetracking data. It uses the algorithm for saccade detection proposed by Ralf Engbert and Reinhold Kliegl. Any period occurring between two saccades is considered to be a fixation.

This software is a re-implementation of an earlier package that we used heavily in our research. However, I wrote the old package when I was new to R and the code was somewhat clumsy. Hence, the rewrite.

Note that the new code is not tested as much as the earlier package and it may have bugs. For my data it works beautifully but your mileage may vary.

Things that I plan to add in the future are tools for reading common file formats for eyetracking data and tools for assessing the quality of the fixation detection. A lot of this code already exists in the old package and I will migrate it in small steps. For example, we have a highly efficient parser for EDF files that uses the edf-library provided by SR Research.

** Install package
To install the latest version of the package, execute the following two lines in R:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value output :eval no
library("devtools")
install_github("tmalsburg/saccades/saccades", dependencies=TRUE)
#+END_SRC

Note that this package depends on the R pacakge ~zoom~ which will be automatically installed with the commands above.

** Getting started
If you want to play with the package, this is how you get started:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value output
library(saccades)
data(samples)
head(samples)
#+END_SRC

      time     x      y trial
1    0 53.18 375.73     1
2    4 53.20 375.79     1
3    8 53.35 376.14     1
4   12 53.92 376.39     1
5   16 54.14 376.52     1
6   20 54.46 376.74     1

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value output
fixations <- detect.fixations(samples)
head(fixations[c(1,4,5,10)])
#+END_SRC

  trial        x         y  dur
0     1 53.81296 377.40741   71
1     1 39.68156 379.58711  184
2     1 59.99267 379.92467   79
3     1 18.97898  56.94046  147
4     1 40.28365  39.03599  980
5     1 47.36547  35.39441 1310

If you want to examine the results of the saccade detection visually, you can use the function ~diagnostic.plot~:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value output :eval no
diagnostic.plot(samples, fixations)
#+END_SRC

This function will open an interactive plot showing the original samples and the detected fixations. The plot can be used to navigate the whole data set using the mouse or keyboard. Here's a screenshot:

The dots are the raw samples. Red dots represent the x-coordinate and orange the y-coordinate. The vertical lines mark the on- and offsets of fixations. The horizontal lines (difficult to see in the screenshot) represent the fixations.

The function ~calculate.summary~ prints some summary statistics about the detected fixations:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value output
stats <- calculate.summary(fixations)
round(stats, digits=2)
#+END_SRC

** Blinks
The package currently doesn't offer blink detection. However, blinks are fairly easy to spot. In the graph below you can see a blink. It starts with something that looks like a saccade, then there's a fixation on the coordinates (0,0), and then another saccade. (SMI eyetrackers specify coordinates as (0,0) when there was track loss.  EyeLink-trackers use 1e+08 for the same purpose.)
